"""
`LyProX`_ is a `Django`_ app to interactively explore patterns of lymphatic progression.

This is the documentation for the `source code`_ of the `LyProX`_ web app. It is
intended for developers who want to contribute to the project oder use the code for
their own purposes.

We will try to write this documentation as self-contained as possible, because in
our experience, the `Django`_ documentation is not always easy to navigate and learning
by example is often more effective.

The most important modules in this package are:

- the `settings`, where all the configuration of the website is defined. Most
  importantly, it documents all the environment variables that need to be set
  to run the website.
- the `dataexplorer` module, which provides the interactive data exploration tool
  that is the heart of the website.
