"""Risk predictions for involvement patterns, given personalized diagnoses.

This prediction is based on the probabilistic hidden Markov model we developed to
model lymphatic metastatic progression in head and neck cancer [1]_.

The underlying code to compute the risks lives in the GitHub repository `lymph`_ and
can be installed from `PyPI`_
