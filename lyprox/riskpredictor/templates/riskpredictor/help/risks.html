  This panel displays the marginalized posterior risk of microscopic disease for each
  of the lymph node levels. The three-way toggle buttons next to each level allow to
  indicate which levels were clinically observed to harbor metastases or to appear
  healthy. Together with the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic modality,
  this information is considered in the calculation of the risk.
